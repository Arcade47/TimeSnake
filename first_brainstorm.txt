A) snake in 3 dimensions
	benefits:
		- no ground
		- easy orthogonality (not moving in time)
		- no time passes automatically, but can only see 2 dimensions

B) few generations of persons
	can only move in 2D (space dimensions)
	generations: "stone age", "middle age", "future age" (maybe with time travellers)

C) display of snake length
	can be shortened via:
		eating its own tial somewhere
		hit by humans' weapons
	can be elongated via:
		eating humans

D) highscore system
	yoink from Beste game

E) interaction of time dim with humans?
	- option 1: moving in space, ignoring time
		humans are stationary; easy
		disabling this option? only difficulty would be not hitting oneself
	- option 2: moving in spacedim1 and time, ignoring spacedim2
		forward in time:
			humans can react
		backwards in time:
			stored behavior is read out, future is cleared			
	- how would it look for humans?

F) AI?

G) music that flows with current time movement

H) computational optimization
	only AA lines of snake
		--> just store corner points
	store people's actions as vectors
	clear dir change history when beyond snake length

I) language and setup
	JS on own webserver
	no scrolling, fixed block size (200 x 200)
	smartphone implementation only if there is time left

J) items
	dimension changing items are constantly visible across auto dim ("pillar")

K) snake dynamics
	if no movement: still movement in time
		need 3D view to see updates
