should time flow for snake as well?
+ easier for "humans", since
	a) there is some continuousness
	b) snake cannot be everywhere at once in present
- results in diagonal movements in grid
	however, if only points are stored, this shouldn't be a big problem

ONLY move in time (left/right?)
	NO:
		would need to be stationary, humans would win at some point or no dof
